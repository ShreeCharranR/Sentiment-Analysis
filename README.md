# Sentiment-Analysis
The key idea is to predict the potential sentiment of a body of text based on the textual content.



1.	Prepare train and test datasets (optionally a validation dataset)
2.	Pre-process and normalize text documents
3.	Feature Engineering 
4.	Model training
5.	Model prediction and evaluation

These are the major steps for building our system. Optionally the last step would be to deploy the model in your server or on the cloud. The following figure shows a detailed workflow for building a standard text classification system with supervised learning (classification) models.

In our scenario, documents indicate the movie reviews and classes indicate the review sentiments which can either be positive or negative making it a binary classification problem. We will build models using both traditional machine learning methods and newer deep learning in the subsequent sections.
